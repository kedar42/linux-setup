# linux-setup
A script for setting up my sway arch
Currently it is highly unlikely that this script will work for other people
It is mostly hardcoded for my specs (mostly the settings)
It is to be run over EndeavourOS sway community edition and the config is highly based on that


### TODO look into better dual boot options, find replacement for ranger
